              <p class="mb-0">The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and 
                subtropical Americas, Eurasia, and North Africa and has been introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Peru, 
                Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, the Falkland Islands, and South Africa. This duck belongs to the subfamily 
                Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae. The male birds (drakes) have a glossy green head and are grey on 
                wings and belly while the females (hens or ducks) have mainly brown-speckled plumage. Both sexes have an area 
                of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings; males especially tend to 
                have blue speculum feathers. It is 50–65 cm (20–26 in) long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the 
                length. The wingspan is 81–98 cm (32–39 in) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in) long. It is often 
                slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing 0.72–1.58 kg (1.6–3.5 lb). Mallards live in wetlands, 
                eat water plants and small animals, and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of 
                varying sizes. This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">The redhead (Aythya americana) is a medium-sized diving duck. The scientific name is derived 
                from Greek aithuia an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin 
                americana, of America. The redhead is 37 cm (15 in) long with an 84 cm (33 in) wingspan. It belongs to the 
                genus Aythya, together with 11 other described species. The redhead and the common pochard form a sister 
                group which together is sister to the canvasback.
                  The redhead goes by many names, including the red-headed duck and the red-headed pochard. This waterfowl 
                  is easily distinguished from other ducks by the male’s copper coloured head and bright blue bill during 
                  the breeding season.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">The gadwall (Mareca strepera) is a common and widespread dabbling duck in the family Anatidae. 
                The gadwall is 46–56 cm (18–22 in) long with a 78–90 cm (31–35 in) wingspan. The male is slightly larger 
                than the female, weighing on average 990 g (35 oz) against her 850 g (30 oz). The breeding male is patterned 
                grey, with a black rear end, light chestnut wings, and a brilliant white speculum, obvious in flight or at rest. 
                In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the female, but retains the male wing pattern, 
                and is usually greyer above and has less orange on the bill.
                  The female is light brown, with plumage much like a female mallard. It can be distinguished from that 
                  species by the dark orange-edged bill, smaller size, the white speculum, and white belly. Both sexes go 
                  through two moults annually, following a juvenile moult.
                  The gadwall is a quieter duck, except during its courtship display. Females give a call similar to the 
                  quack of a female mallard but higher-pitched, transcribed as gag-ag-ag-ag. Males give a grunt, transcribed 
                  as nheck, and a whistle.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">The canvasback (Aythya valisineria) is a species of diving duck, the largest found in North America. 
                  It ranges from 48–56 cm (19–22 in) in length and weighs 862–1,600 g (1.900–3.527 lb), with a wingspan of 79–89 cm 
                  (31–35 in). It is the largest species in the Aythya genus, being similar in size to a mallard but with a heavier 
                  and more compact build than it. 191 males wintering in western New York averaged 1,252 g (2.760 lb) and 54 females 
                  there averaged 1,154 g (2.544 lb). The canvasback has a distinctive wedge-shaped head and long graceful neck. 
                  The adult male (drake) has a black bill, a chestnut red head and neck, a black breast, a grayish back, black rump, 
                  and a blackish brown tail. The drake’s sides, back, and belly are white with fine vermiculation resembling the 
                  weave of a canvas, which gave rise to the bird’s common name. The bill is blackish and the legs and feet are 
                  bluish-gray. The iris is bright red in the spring, but duller in the winter. The adult female (hen) also has a 
                  black bill, a light brown head and neck, grading into a darker brown chest and foreback. The sides, flanks, 
                  and back are grayish brown. The bill is blackish and the legs and feet are bluish-gray. Its sloping profile 
                  distinguishes it from other ducks.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">The lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) is a small North American diving duck that migrates south as 
                    far as Central America in winter. It is colloquially known as the little bluebill or broadbill because of its 
                    distinctive blue bill. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird’s preference for feeding on scalp—the 
                    Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female’s discordant scaup call 
                    as the name’s source. It is apparently a very close relative of the Holarctic greater scaup or “bluebill” 
                    (A. marila), with which it forms a superspecies. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek aithuia 
                    an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin, affinis “related to”, 
                    from its resemblance to the greater scaup.
                      Adults are 38–48 cm (15–19 in) long, 41.7–43 cm (16.4–16.9 in) on average. The adult males (drakes) in 
                      alternate plumage have a black, iridescent head and a small tuft at the hindcrown, a black breast, 
                      a whitish-grey back and wings with darker vermiculations and black outer and greyish-brown inner primary remiges. 
                      The underparts are white with some olive vermiculations on the flanks, and the rectrices and tail coverts are black. 
                      Adult females (hens) have a white band at the base of the bill, often a lighter ear region, and are otherwise 
                      dark brown all over, shading to white on the mid-belly. Drakes in eclipse plumage look similar, but with a very 
                      dark head and breast, little or no white on the head and usually some greyish vermiculations on the wings. 
                      Immature birds resemble the adult females, but are duller and have hardly any white at the bill base.</p>
